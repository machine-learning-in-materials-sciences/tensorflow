This chapter intends to introduce the main objects and concepts in TensorFlow.  We also 
introduce how to access the data for the rest of the book and provide additional resources
for learning about TensorFlow.

TensorFlow如何工作
=================

Here we introduce TensorFlow and the general outline of how most TensorFlow algorithms work.
 
变量和张量的声明
===============

How to create and initialize tensors in TensorFlow.  We also depict how these operations appear in Tensorboard.

使用占位符和变量
===============

How to create and use variables and placeholders in TensorFlow.  We also depict how these operations appear in Tensorboard.



矩阵
======

Understanding how TensorFlow can work with matrices is crucial to understanding how the algorithms work.

操作符的声明
===========

How to use various mathematical operations in TensorFlow.

载入激活函数
==========

Activation functions are unique functions that TensorFlow has built in for your use in algorithms.

数据资源
=========

Here we show how to access all the various required data sources in the book. There are also links describing
the data sources and where they come from.

资源库
======

Mostly official resources and papers.  The papers are TensorFlow papers or Deep Learning resources.
