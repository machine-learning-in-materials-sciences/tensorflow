Implementing Unit Tests
========================

We show how to implement different types of unit tests on tensors (placeholders and variables).

Using Multiple Executors (Devices)
==================================

How to use a machine with multiple devices.  E.g., a machine with a CPU, and one or more GPUs.

Parallelizing TensorFlow

How to setup and use TensorFlow distributed on multiple machines.

Tips for TensorFlow in Production
==================================

Various tips for developing with TensorFlow

An Example of Productionalizing TensorFlow
===========================================

We show how to do take the RNN model for predicting ham/spam (from Chapter 9, recipe #2) and put 
it in two production level files: training and evaluation.
