Convolutional Neural Networks
=============================

Introduction
-------------

We introduce convolutional neural networks (CNN), and how we can use them in TensorFlow.

Implementing a Simple CNN
---------------------------

Here, we show how to create a CNN architecture that performs well on the MNIST digit recognition
task.

Implementing an Advanced CNN
------------------------------

In this example, we show how to replicate an architecture for the CIFAR-10 image recognition task.

Retraining an Existing Architecture
-----------------------------------

We show how to download and setup the CIFAR-10 data for the `TensorFlow retraining-fine-tuning tutorial <https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/inception>`_

Using Stylenet/NeuralStyle
--------------------------

In this recipe, we show a basic implementation of using Stylenet or Neuralstyle.

Implementing Deep Dream
--------------------------

This script shows a line-by-line explanation of TensorFlow's deepdream tutorial. Taken from 
`Deepdream on TensorFlow <https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/deepdream>`_
Note that the code here is converted to Python 3.
